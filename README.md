The goal of `{validamiiid}` is to edit and validate information on intermicrobial interaction data against the MIIID metadata schema using a [`{shiny}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny) application, built with [`{golem}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=golem). Correct information can be submitted directly to a GitHub repository for review.
