The goal of [`{validamiiid}`](https://github.com/FAIR-MI/validamiiid) is to edit and validate description of intermicrobial interaction data against the [MIIID metadata schema](https://github.com/FAIR-MI/miiid-schema) using a [`{shiny}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny) application, built with [`{golem}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=golem). Correct descriptions can be submitted directly to the [MIIID GitHub repository](https://github.com/FAIR-MI/miiid-schema/issues) as issues for review.
