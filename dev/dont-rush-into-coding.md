## Questions


> Who are the end users of your app?

* Scientists studying microbial interaction
* Data stewards interested in metadata and schema validation
* Curious FEMS conference attendees 


> Are they tech-literate?

Not necessarily

> In which context will they be using your app?

* Out of curiosity during the conference
* Later on, during the documentation of their data

> On what machines (computer, tablet, smartphone, or any other device)?

* Smartphone for the conference
* Computers for later

> Are there any restrictions when it comes to the browser they are using? (For example, are they still using an old version of Internet Explorer?)

> Will they be using the app in their office, on their phone while driving a tractor, in a plant, or while wearing a lab coat?


# Personas

## Lin (microbiologist)

Lin is a microbiologist performing co-cultures experiments using bioreactors and sometimes get the help of bioinformaticians and modellers to predict interactions using genome-scale metabolic model.
She attended the FEMs conference where the MIIID schema was presented and wanted to try out the valida-miiid to see if it could be useful for her research.
While she has the knowledge of her study system, she is not tech-literate. She is curious to learn more about metadata in this context, while wondering if it is worth to invest time in it.


## Akim (data steward)

Akim is data steward in a research group that generates different types of data, intermicrobial interaction data among them. He is familiar with the importance of metadata and he is experienced in dealing with metadata schema (mainly JSON schema). However, he does not have domain knowledge. He was asked to look into the MIIID schema thanks to a colleague that saw a mention of the schema in social media.
